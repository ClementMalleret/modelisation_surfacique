# TP MODELISATION SURFACIQUE

This archive contains the TP of Cl√©ment Malleret.

You can find here a report.pdf file, containing my answers to the theorical questions, and the
different observations asked.

To do this TP, I used 2 classes: one for Patches, and one for the total Surface.

# Executing the code

## Prerequisites
-numpy
-matplotlib

## Running the code
You can run yourself every command I used to write the report.
For this, simply edit the "main.py" file, and uncomment the line corresponding to what you want
to execute. Then, simply launch the file by doing "./main.py".
