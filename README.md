# TP MODELISATION SURFACIQUE

This archive contains the TP of Cl√©ment Malleret.

You can find here a report.pdf file, containing my answers to the theorical questions, and the
different observations asked.

The Images folders contains every image used for the report (they are also present in report.pdf).
The source code can be found in the 'src' folder.
The surfaces files can be found in the 'surfaces' folder.


# Executing the code

## Prerequisites
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Running the code
You can run yourself every command I used to write the report.
For this, simply go to the src folder, and edit the "main.py" file, and uncomment the line
corresponding to what you want to execute. Then, simply launch the file by doing "./main.py".
For the project to run, you have to start it from the 'src' folder.
